Id-List-Tryout
==============

This is a tryout to solve the problem that describe in index.html and also a tryout to use `Requirejs` on browser side.

## Build the app

To sreve the application you need a server running Node.js with NPM installed. Step to get the web server running:

    cd Id-List-Tryout
    npm install
    node app.js

the node server uses port 3000 by default, so you can go to ```http://localhost:3000/```

## Testing
The test is being done by Qunit: http://qunitjs.com

To run the test, please firstly build the app, and run the server: ```node app.js```
then go to ```http://localhost:3000/test```

## Covered Cases
please check `case covered`

## Others

This is my first tryout to use `Requirejs` style on brower side, while I used to use it on `Node`. 
If there is any thing that doesn't look good, please leave me an issue, we can disscuss it!
